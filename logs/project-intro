# Project Log 1 – Autonomous Mosquito-Killing Turret

## Backstory

I separated from the military around June 2021, working as a greenside Navy corpsman with a Marine Corps infantry unit. When I applied to my local community college, my plan was to go to physician assistant school, bouncing between psychology and biology.

After earning two associate degrees, I transferred to university. During my first year, I started falling out of love with medicine and realized it wasn’t what I wanted anymore. I was taking my first calculus class — and surprisingly, I was doing well, despite past struggles with math in high school.

As a big gun enthusiast, engineering seemed like the next logical step.

I talked to a few engineering grad students who played on the same Esports team as me. I asked about the kinds of work engineers actually do and brought up concerns like:  
> "All engineers do is sit in a cubicle all day and work in CAD."

They quickly shot that down and pointed me to a faculty member running a defense-related research program. During our meeting, I asked a lot of questions about switching career paths after 9+ years in the medical field. He said something like:  
> "Go with your gut — the only person who can make that decision is you. It sounds like you've already made up your mind."

A few hours later, I was in my academic advisor’s office switching my major.

## Why I’m Doing This

By the end of my sophomore year in the BSME program, I wanted to start getting experience. Summer internships were off the table due to enrollment in summer classes, so I applied to the on-campus research program.

After months of emails, reminder follow-ups, and camping outside professors’ offices — I finally got the interview.

It lasted about an hour. Then they told me I wasn’t getting the position due to a lack of experience.

I asked how I was supposed to *get* experience if I couldn’t even get hired. I was told to “learn to code,” “mess around in SolidWorks,” “get your drone pilot’s license,” etc.

Afterward, I sat in my car frustrated — hopefully this doesn’t sound entitled — but I didn’t want to just “learn code.” I wanted to do something wild. Something that forced me to grow. Something **undeniable**.

So I decided to build a self-funded, AI-powered turret that tracks and eliminates mosquitoes in real time.

My goal wasn’t just to kill bugs — it was to prove that I could design, build, and document a complete system from scratch. One that combines mechanical design, computer vision, embedded hardware, and AI.

This project doesn’t necessarily align with the drone-focused research group, but it fits where I want to go — toward the defense industry. It’s my answer to every future employer or grad school who asks,  
> “What have you built?”

Well… here it is.

## Final Words

Thank you to whoever stumbles across this and decides to read and follow along as I finish the project. I'm very open to critiques or general advice from more experienced folks. I'm new to GitHub and still learning the ropes.

If this repo starts seeing traffic, maybe I’ll toss in an email.  
Again, thanks for reading.
